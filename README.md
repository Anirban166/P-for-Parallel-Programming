# P-for-Parallel-Programming
Contains **some** parallel programs that I wrote while experimenting with the POSIX threads api.

> Emphasizing on 'some', given that there are sequential programs here as well, including ones that are worser than their normal sequential run (equivalent with no threads), due to factors such as locking overhead.
